                    <h3><i>Early Life</i></h3>
                    <p>I live in Lagos, Nigeria. Growing up, we had a computer at home, which was primarily used for
                        playing games. This
                        early exposure to technology sparked my curiosity about engineering and problem-solving.</p>

                    <h3><i>Professional Journey</i></h3>
                    <p>I am a graduate of marine engineering. My career began as a safety engineer for a pasta plant,
                        where I developed
                        critical skills in ensuring operational safety and efficiency. Currently, I am proud to be
                        working at a tech
                        firm where I am actively learning and growing. Joining Alt School Africa is another milestone in
                        my journey, as
                        it allows me to develop my skills further and expand my technical expertise.</p>

                    <h3><i>Hobbies and Interests</i></h3>
                    <p>In my free time, I enjoy watching political shows and historical stories. I am a passionate
                        Manchester United fan
                        and thoroughly enjoy engaging in football banter. Additionally, I love listening to music from
                        artists like
                        Beyonc√©, Taylor Swift, and Ed Sheeran.</p>

                    <h3><i>Challenges and Values</i></h3>
                    <p>One challenge I have faced is the feeling that I am not doing enough, but I continue to push
                        myself to grow and
                        improve. I believe strongly in integrity and honesty, striving to be truthful in everything I
                        do.</p>
